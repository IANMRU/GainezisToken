## Environmental Setup

To set up the software environment, please follow the steps below:

1. Install Node.js and npm:
```
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install nodejs npm
```
2. Install development packages:
```
  sudo apt install build-essential
```
3. Clone the project repository:
```
  git clone https://github.com/your-repo/your-project.git
  cd your-project
```
4. Install dependencies:
```
  npm install
```

## Blockchain Structure

Blockchain design: **YOUR_DESIGN_HERE**

After setting up the environment, create a logical and functional design of the blockchain structure. This includes designing the blockchain infrastructure such as the consensus algorithm, block hashing, and rewards for mining.

## Node Software GUI

To develop an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the nodes in the system, create a user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Use Webpack and Babel to transpile and bundle your code, and make sure the application is compatible with the majority of modern web browsers.

Once the environmental setup and design are complete, review the setup and designs, and proceed with token generation and finalizing the remaining tasks.
