# Blockchain System Architecture
## Environmental Setup and Design

### Environmental Setup

The environmental setup for this project includes setting up the software tools and libraries required for the development and production environments:

1. Node.js v16.x
2. Python >= 3.8
3. Solidity v0.8.x (For Smart Contracts)
4. Truffle (For Deploying and Testing Smart Contracts)
5. Web3.js (For Node.js & Browser-based apps)
6. React (For Front-end/UI components)
7. Redux (For State Management)

Apart from these libraries, set up version control using Git and a project management tool to enhance collaboration among team members.

### Design

The design of the blockchain structure includes a multi-chain architecture with a central blockchain that connects with multiple other blockchains. The central blockchain records transactions between different banks and facilitates the exchange of tokens.

The node software GUI is designed for easy interaction between users and the system. The GUI should include the following features:

1. A login page for users to enter their credentials
2. A dashboard showcasing the user's account balance and transaction history
3. Icons to easily access different features, such as loans, staking, and transferring tokens
4. A settings page for users to customize their experience
5. A help section for users to access documentation and customer support

A wireframe or mockup should be created to visualize the layout and user experience.

This document outlines the high-level design and architecture for the blockchain system, which includes a central blockchain connecting with Central Bank, Reserve Bank, Development Bank, and at least 62 other existing blockchains. The design incorporates components for transactions, fund transfer, cross-chain bridging, loaning, staking, and AI supervision.



## Components



1. **Transactions**: The system must support various types of transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between banks and their customers.

2. **Fund Transfer**: The central blockchain will facilitate the transfer of funds between different banks and blockchains.


2.1. **Inchain Transfers**: The system must be able to transfer tokens within the blockchain network. When a user sends tokens, the corresponding fiat value should be deducted from the sender's account and added to the receiver's account.
3. **Cross-Chain Bridging**: The system must have the capability to interact with other blockchains to support cross-chain transactions and communication.

4. **Loaning**: Banks should be able to issue loans to customers through the system with appropriate terms and conditions.

5. **Staking**: Customers and financial institutions can stake their tokens/coins to earn interest or participate in governing the blockchain system.

6. **AI Supervision**: An AI-driven supervision system monitors the blockchain to ensure security and adherence to regulations.
7. **Bank API Integration**: The system must include a banking API integration component that allows access to account information, transaction history, and other necessary data while adhering to relevant regulations and security standards.
7. **Node Registration**: Only registered businesses are allowed to operate nodes in the main blockchain. The system will have a registration process in place to verify the node operators and ensure compliance with the country's rules and regulations.

8. **Fiat Currency Transaction Monitoring**: Develop a component for monitoring fiat currency transactions within the bank's ledger system. When a new transaction occurs, trigger the creation of a new block containing the transaction details.



## Central Bank, Reserve Bank, Development Bank, and Other Banks



The central blockchain will connect with the Central bank, Reserve bank, Development bank, and other banks. Each bank will interact with the central blockchain using smart contracts and APIs specifically designed for their needs.



## Next Steps
## Registered Business Nodes

The main blockchain will require registered businesses to operate nodes. This ensures that no single PC can act as a node and promotes transparency and adherence to KYC processes. This system will help prevent fraud and money laundering as required by the country's rules and regulations.





Once the architecture is finalized, proceed with the following tasks:
1. Develop the inchain transfers implementation, including sending and receiving tokens within the blockchain network and the corresponding fiat value transfers.

1. Develop smart contracts for each bank interaction, including Central bank, Reserve bank, and Development bank.

1.1. Ensure compatibility with the designed architecture.
2. Set up the main blockchain with registered business nodes.

3. Create APIs for banks to communicate with the blockchain.

4. Develop AI for supervision and security.

5. Implement cross-chain communication and bridging.


6. Implement Fiat Currency Transaction Monitoring: Develop a component for monitoring fiat currency transactions within the bank's ledger system. When a new transaction occurs, trigger the creation of a new block containing the transaction details.
